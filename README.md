[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://dashboard.render.com/blueprint/new?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrunyssite%2FBrunysIXLWork-Portable)

## run npm i

### when it is done run node index.js
### if you have any errors just install the packages it is asking for

- any deploy service should work just fine
- this is NOT source code, it's just a proxy so that anyone can deploy
- NO STATIC DEPLOYMENTS WILL WORK, THIS IS A NODE.JS FILE!

## remember, BRUNYSIXLWORK ON TOP!
